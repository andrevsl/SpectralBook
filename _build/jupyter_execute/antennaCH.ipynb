    "## 1 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Antenna design is an important part of the development of  many electronic devices and for new generations of mobiles telecommunications systems. Mobility and comfort are some advantages that wireless communications provide to society. Different techniques for antenna optimization are used in literature, however, sometimes without translate and interpret physically some basic principles for researchers and engineers. These insights can be essential and very useful in antenna design, giving many degrees of freedom to antenna engineer and researchers to optimize their structures. We aim to build an overview of some approaches that can help antennas engineer in the optimization and physical understanding.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The antenna can be viewed by three perspectives in accordance with [1]-[3]. Firstly, as a transducer that couple electric power into radiated electromagnetic energy. Secondly as an electric circuit element, a powerful tool and maybe the preferred for the most radiofrequency (RF) engineers, aided especially by smith charts and transmission line theory [3]. And finally by electromagnetic (EM) view, where the field’s distribution should comply with Maxwell’s equations. In this context, metasurfaces and transformation optics techniques that control EM’s signatures efficiently have been widely employed after Pendry [4] and Leonhardt [5] disclosure of the electromagnetic cloak.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, solving analytically complex electromagnetic problems can be laborious. Computational techniques as Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Difference Time Doman (FDTD), Method of Moments and Integral Methods are preferred to simplify and accelerate the analysis in the design process [2],[6]-[7]. Generally, commercial software provides built-in optimization algorithms as interpolated quasi newton, particle swarm, and genetic algorithm [8]-[9]. However, it works well for fine-tune mostly, being the initial concept and design still dependent on the physical basis of the researches and antenna engineers.\n"

    "\n",
    "As pointed out in previous chapter, antenna may be analyzed by three different kinds of operation, as a transducer, a radiator and, an electric circuit element, being all intrinsic related to each other. The radiation quality may be evaluated by its energy conversion efficiency, equivalent circuit parameters behavior as by its radiation characteristics. These items are discussed in following sub items."

    "Good radiation is the main objective of antenna design and, an analysis by means of electromagnetic theory is essential to predict and improve antenna performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, solving the Helmholtz homogeneous wave equation is the starting step to solve any electromagnetic problem [10]-[11]. As a consequence of being a second-order differential equation and a linear operator, the solution of wave equation yields a linear combination of eigenfunctions that depending on the coordinate system, can be even harmonic functions as sines, cosines, and complex exponentials, satisfying Laplace equation for the Cartesian coordinate system, or Bessel’s functions well fitted for cylindrical and spherical coordinates [11]. Meanwhile, the eigenvalues are always related to the wave phase constant (frequency) as shown in (2b), in frequency domain form [12]. In order to ensure the uniqueness theorem, proper Cauchy boundary conditions must be applied to these Sturm-Liouville problems [14].\n",

    "Then, applying Fourier Spectral transform twice in (2a) over space domain similar to the Fourier transformation that yields frequency form, we obtain equation (4a) and (4b). From it, we can infer that to respect the wave equation, electromagnetic fields radiated should vary over space with an angular (or spatial) wave constant equal to the time/frequency wave constant (eigenvalue). In others words, EM field’s spatial oscillation should have the same period of the time oscillations. If for a given eigenvalue, fields do not respect this condition, it will vanish rapidly.\n",

In this context, energy efficiency is often a major concern for their applications. Thus, electromagnetic radiated power by an antenna should be as close as possible of the electric power delivered at its terminals. Being the radiated electromagnetic power dependent of the electric field E and magnetic field H as expressed in (1a), and for electric counterpart, from voltage V and current I (1b) [10]."

    "\n",
    "Therefore, if these assumptions are applied to the canonical half wavelength dipole, we can find out why it is a well suitable radiator. As mandatory by boundary conditions, the current and fields, and its differentiations should vanish at the end of dipoles due to conductor discontinuity. Once, a narrowband excitation is applied at the antenna terminals with frequency f (related to wavelength λ in free space, and to c, light velocity in free space, where c=λf), as depicted in Fig. 1. Field’s and current’s oscillations over space will match λ/2, half period of sine function, eigenfunction of Helmholtz equation solution for Cartesian coordinates as in eq. (3) and, oscillating at time with the related operation frequency f of excitation. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the problem can be solved and expressed by means of the wave equation basis. Otherwise, for dipoles with dimension very small compared to the wavelength, field’s variation condition over the space starts to not be fulfilled perfectly by the sine or cosine function at the related frequency as depicted in Fig. 2(b), and fields will vanish rapidly, providing a poor radiation efficiency. For long dipoles, possessing dimensions equal or greater than half wavelength, the field distribution can be fulfilled by appropriate eigenfunctions. In addition, in this case it will present more poles of radiation that will interfere with each other, either constructively or destructively at some zones of the space. This is explained by Fresnel-Huygens diffraction, where each new wavelet acts as a new source of wavelets [11]-[12]. When these are out of phase in a certain point of space, it generates destructive interference, otherwise, if in phase, constructive interference as a wavelength dipole in Fig. 2(c), two poles of radiation arises like a two element array. Nevertheless, the impedance matching will not be perfect for all wavelengths, only for odd multiples of λ/2. This is further discussed in subsection C.\n",
